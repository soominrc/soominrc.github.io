            Color theory throughout the year beautifully reflects the changing moods and feelings that each season brings. In spring, the world bursts into life with vibrant greens and soft pastels, evoking a sense of renewal and hope. Artists often capture this energy in their work, celebrating the freshness of nature. As summer rolls in, warm yellows and bright blues create a joyful, lively atmosphere, perfect for depicting sunny days and outdoor adventures. When autumn arrives, the landscape transforms into a warm palette of reds, oranges, and browns, inviting a sense of nostalgia and reflection as we witness the transition of nature. Finally, winter brings cooler tones—deep blues and whites—that create a peaceful, introspective vibe, often inspiring artists to explore themes of stillness and contemplation. Throughout the year, the interplay of colors not only enhances artistic expression but also mirrors our own emotional journeys tied to the seasons. These images here show some contrast between cool and warm tone palettes.
